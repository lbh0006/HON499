     Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there was a sickness in the land. The king’s sister, who
was loved by all, was one of the many who became ill, and much to the sorrow of the kingdom, she
passed away. She had a son, whom the king adored, but who had not yet begun working on a trade,
so the king decided to take him under his wing.

The king summoned him into the throne room and told him:

     ‘You are growing older, and have still not decided what you are going to do with your life. It is time
     you learned a trade of some sort, and here, today, I have summoned the Captain of the Guard and a
     talented Minstrel of the King’s court for you to talk to. See if you would like to study under one of them.
     If so, you can become something great, but if you do not find something to do here, you will have to
     leave and make a living elsewhere, so let me know your decision by the end of the day.’

And with that the king dismissed him from his presence.

The boy noticed the beautiful princess visiting the king's court, so he went to talk to her. She had a lovely
disposition and seemed happy to talk to him.

     The boy went to the Captain of the Guard, who showed him his sword and shield. He demonstrated some of
the basic training techniques, and spoke of the glory that came with being a knight and defending the kingdom.
Then he told him if he trained hard, he could join the forces to fight for the king.

     The boy went to the Minstrel, who showed him a flute and a lyre. He told him about what a minstrel’s
life was like-- attending parties and events and providing entertainment for the king. He offered to teach
him the lyre.

The boy thought the lyre looked interesting, and so asked if he could try it. The minstrel handed it over,
and showed him how to play a song. He said,

     ‘If you keep practicing, then soon, you should be able to perform with me at some of the king’s events.’

The boy thought the lyre looked interesting, and so asked if he could try it. The minstrel handed it over,
and showed him how to play a song. He said,

     ‘If you keep practicing, then soon, you should be able to perform with me at some of the king’s events.’

     The boy went to the Captain of the Guard, who showed him his sword and shield. He demonstrated some of
the basic training techniques, and spoke of the glory that came with being a knight and defending the kingdom.
Then he told him if he trained hard, he could join the forces to fight for the king.

The boy decided to try some of the Captain's training techniques, and so spent some time practicing his combat skills.
     After thinking about it for a while, the boy decided that defending the kingdom was a task he would be proud to
spend his life doing, so he went to the king and told him,

     'If it pleases your magesty, I would like to study under the Captain of the Guard to become a knight of the king's
      court.'

This pleased the king very much, and so he congratulated him on his decision and welcomed him into his guard.

The End.
